## Project Overview

Electrical drives are critical components in industrial automation and robotics. Early detection of faults can prevent costly downtime and equipment damage. Motix-AI uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from drives, identify abnormal patterns, and provide diagnostic feedback.

## Features

- Supports multiple types of electrical drives and fault conditions.
- Automated feature extraction and selection from raw drive data.
- Various ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for fault classification.
- Visualization and reporting tools for diagnostics.
- Modular and extensible codebase.

## How it Works

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collect operational data from electrical drives (e.g., current, voltage, vibration).
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and segment the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract statistical, time-domain, and frequency-domain features.
4. **Model Training**: Train ML models to classify normal and faulty states.
5. **Fault Diagnosis**: Deploy trained models for real-time or batch inference.
6. **Reporting**: Generate diagnostic reports and visualizations.

## Dataset

> _Describe the dataset here. For example:_
- **Source:** [Link or description of data origin]
- **Size:** XX samples; YY features
