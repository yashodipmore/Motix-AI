# Motix-AI

Motix-AI is a machine learning project focused on classification tasks using various algorithms. After analyzing the repository and running experiments, the following models were evaluated:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**  
  - Achieved the highest accuracy of **93%**
  - Recommended as the best-performing model for this dataset

- **Random Forest (RF):**  
  - Achieved lower accuracy compared to KNN

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**  
  - Also achieved lower accuracy compared to KNN

## Highlights

- **Best Model:** KNN (93% accuracy)
- **Other Models:** RF and SVM (less accurate)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashodipmore/Motix-AI.git
   cd Motix-AI
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the main script to train and evaluate models.

## Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| KNN   | 93%      |
| RF    | <93%     |
| SVM   | <93%     |

KNN is recommended for best results on this project.
